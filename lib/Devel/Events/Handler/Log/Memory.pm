=head1 NAME

Devel::Events::Handler::Log::Memory - An optional base role for event generators.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Devel::Events::Handler::Log::Memory;

	my $log = Devel::Events::Handler::Log::Memory->new();

	Some::Geneator->new( handler => $log );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This convenience role provides a basic C<send_event> method, useful for
implementing generators.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over 4

=item events

The list of events.

Auto derefs.

=item matcher

The L<Devel::Events::Match> instance used for event matching.

=back

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item clear

Remove all events from the log.

Provided by L<MooseX::AttributeHelpers>.

=item first $cond

=item first %args

Return the first event that matches a certain condition.

Delegates to L<Devel::Events::Match>.

=item grep $cond

=item grep %args

Return the list of events that match a certain condition.

Delegates to L<Devel::Events::Match>.

=item limit from => $cond, to => $cond, %args

Return events between two events. If if C<from> or C<to> is omitted then it
returns all the events up to or from the other filter.

Delegates to L<Devel::Events::Match>.

=item chunk $marker

=item chunk %args

Cuts the event log into chunks. When C<$marker> matches a new chunk is opened.

Delegates to L<Devel::Events::Match>.

=item new_event @event

Log the event to the C<events> list by calling C<add_event>.

=item add_event \@event

Provided by L<MooseX::AttributeHelpers>.

=item replay $handler

Replay all the events in the log to $handler.

Useful if C<$handler> does heavy analysis that you want to delay.

There isn't much to it:

	$handler->new_event(@$_) for $self->events;

So obviously you can replay subsets of events manually.

=back

=head1 CAVEATS

If any references are present in the event data then they will be preserved
till the log is clear. This may cause leaks.

To overcome this problem use L<Devel::Events::Filter::Stringify>. It will not
allow overloading unless asked to, so it's safe to use without side effects.

=head1 TODO

Add an option to always hash all the event data for convenience.

Make C<grep> and C<limit> into exportable functions, too.
